# Machine Learning

### Supervised vs Unsupervised

### Continuius vs Discrete

Continuius is used to do machine learning on a range we are trying to measure, for example tempature or age ranges.

Discrete is used for fixed number of items.



### Supervised learning: 

Classification or regression, generalizing from labeled data to unlabeled data.

Features && Labels
